#### Overview & concept of the project
The aim of the project was to consolidate our knowledge of what we have learnt over the past weeks. The project can be accessed through https://iamshola.github.io/project-01/

#### Approach
Before starting my project, I decided to use a grid as the basis of my game and added in any additional divs for my styling process. I believe a grid layout of 6 x 10 would be adequate to enable the various components of the game to be achieved.
